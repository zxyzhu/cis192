The goal of our project is to explore the Twitter and Google Predictions API. We created an app that predicts which Twitter user potentially tweeted a given message. 
Given a Twitter username, we first find the people he/she follows. We then collect tweets from those people and store them inside a CSV file. 
We then upload our data set to Google cloud storage, where we use that data for predictions. We create a training model from that data set. When the training model is built, we let users input a message. We then send a predict request with that message and use the training set to see which user in the set is most likely to have tweeted that message. 
We deployed our app on the Google App Engine.
